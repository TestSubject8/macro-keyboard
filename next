Implement a ReLU to plot the temp (or whatever)

Implement inputs (buttons, find a potentiometer somewhere?)

Order the piezo sensors for the pico

In progress: reference.py -> splits over the available area to pinpoint where the input is coming from
  Needs a binary tree or something to store all the different areas
